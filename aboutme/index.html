    <h2>Luke Warner</h2>
    <p>My name is Luke Warner. I'm from Star, Idaho. I'm the middle child of 5. </p>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. This is the very first website I've ever made. This is my freshman year and so far I love attending school here in Rexburg.</p>
    <p>I love learning about computers and I hope to broaden my skills and become a jack of all trades and master of a few. I like programming and problem solving.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for 12 years now. I served a mission in Bentonville, Arkansas and Osorno, Chile. My favorite scripture is Alma 29:9-10</p>
    <p>"I know that which the Lord hath commanded me, and I glory in it. I do not bglory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.</p>
    <p>And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me."</p>
